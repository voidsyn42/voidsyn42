🧪 Security R&D | 🐍 Python | 📱 Android internals | 🧬 Automation Nerd  
💼 Reverse engineering, code morphing, runtime obfuscation experiments  
💻 Low-level Android tooling | Office doc tinkering (for compatibility, mostly 😉)

## 📌 Featured Projects

- [`onlymacro`](https://github.com/voidsyn42/onlymacro)  
  🔁 Simple converter from VBA macros to OnlyOffice JSON macros.  
  *"Just trying to make old office tricks future-compatible."*

- [`apkfuscator`](https://github.com/voidsyn42/apkfuscator)  
  🛠️ Minimalistic APK smali obfuscation engine.  
  *Proof-of-concept for class/method renaming, string XORing, junk code injection.*

## 💭 Side quests

- Reverse structuring of compiled OOXML files (`.docx/.docm`)
- Custom encrypted config loaders for C2 stagers
- Prototype dynamic PDF metadata injectors (archived 👀)

---

## 🤖 Currently exploring

- .NET runtime obfuscation models  
- Android OTA patching + payload injection  
- DNS-over-TLS for covert control flows

### 🕳️ Small Print

- All code is experimental and for research.  
- If you’re here from a doc, I already know. 🫣
